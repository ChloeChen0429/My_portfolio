*Kunpeng is a mythical creature, symbolizing transformation and freedom.*

*It was from Ancient Chinese Taoist thinker — Zhuangzi's "Wandering in Absolute Freedom".*

*It was originally a giant fish (Kun) in the deep sea and then transformed into a huge bird (Peng), soaring in the sky.*

### Concepts and Goals: Contemporary Interpretation of Zhuangzi's Topology

When your left hand makes the Peng spread its wings for ninety thousand miles and your right hand makes the kun swallow a hundred rivers, in the interaction between humans and technology, who is in the lead after all?

What is Kun? What is Peng? What is me?

##### “周之梦为胡蝶与？胡蝶之梦为周与？” —— “Is Zhou's dream of being a butterfly? Or is the butterfly's dream of being Zhou?”

Kun: The disorder and infinite possibility in the algorithm.

Peng: The iteration after iteration of the algorithm.

Me: A dynamic node in the cyber system, a Schrödinger's subject wandering between biological neural networks and artificial neural networks.

##### “天地与我并生，而万物与我为一” —— “Heaven and the earth live together with me, and the myriad things and I are one.”

The proposition of "materialization" put forward by Zhuangzi emphasizes the continuous transformation and mutual integration among all things. When you interact with the system through gestures, you are both the controller and the "object" influenced by the system. The algorithm finds its "host" in you, and you also become a constantly changing existence under the mapping of the algorithm. 

This is similar to the feedback loop in a topological network, making "me" no longer an independent individual, but a distributed and non-centralized topological node. In this dynamic interaction, the traditional sense of "me" has become a probability flow, a topological existence that oscillates back and forth between bioelectricity, algorithms, and visual feedback.

## Process
### Concept

Chaotic topology of Kun: 

When the right hand triggers the particles to collapse into the shape of "Kun", it is actually the Monte Carlo method looking for local minima in the probability cloud. This algorithmic behavior forms a wonderful resonance with the proposition of "being born and dying simultaneously" in Zhuangzi's "On the Equality of Things" - each particle is both a deterministic three-dimensional coordinate point and the amplitude of a wave function in Hilbert space.

Dimensional expansion of Peng: 

The "Peng"-shaped dimension-raising movement guided by the left hand corresponds to the equipotential surface climb of particle groups in the four-dimensional Perlin noise field. This is not only a mathematical metaphor of "When the sea is in motion, it will migrate to the southern ocean" in "A Happy Excursion", but also a visual interpretation of the concept of connection in differential geometry: the audience's gesture is actually selecting a gauge field in the fiber bundle and guiding the particles to complete the dimensional transition along the parallel movement path.

At this moment, the screen is no longer a display device but becomes the site for falsifying diffeomorphism theorem - those flowing white particles are both the residuals of algorithm convergence and the weak solution of "Heaven and earth are one finger, and all things are one" in Zhuangzi's "On the Equality of Things" in Sobolev space. When the audience finally realizes that their gesture is just the projection of a high-dimensional gauge field in a three-dimensional cross-section, the real "materialization" is completed: the algorithm and the physical body reach an eternal conspiracy in the Atiyah-Bott fixed point theorem.

Later, we use the [TDComfyUI-v.1.0.8](https://github.com/olegchomp/TDComfyUI/releases) plugin to enable calling models within TD. Then, by placing the ComfyUI API into TD, real-time generation can be achieved.

Later on, create a flowing and falling effect using images generated by AI in TD.

In fact, we are trying to reconstruct the visual logic of the Penrose diagram in a digital art way, "digitally inverting" it into a color flow that continuously falls but never lands. This phenomenon is not a simple visual illusion but is based on concept transformations and mathematical metaphors at several levels:

- Projection of Lorentzian manifolds with conformal compactification:
The color flow in the background is actually a mapping of a conformally compactified Lorentzian manifold on a two-dimensional screen. The Lorentzian manifold is a mathematical object that describes the structure of spacetime, while conformal compactification "converges" the infinitely extended spacetime into a finite range, enabling the infinite distance to be represented in a finite way. This mapping allows us to present an infinitely extended and never-ending dynamic flow effect in two-dimensional space.

- Visual paradox of eternal fall:
This effect of continuous falling has a wonderful correspondence with the eternal falling solution in general relativity. In some strong gravitational fields (such as near black holes), objects will continuously fall but the moment when they truly reach the end point is never seen. Here, the color flow symbolizes this dynamic process - they maintain a certain dynamic balance while continuously falling, always approaching but never actually "landing".

### Animation of Kunpeng model
We used Blender to create models and animations of Kunpeng in different forms.

### Touchdesigner Kunpeng construction
We imported the model into TouchDesigner (TD). First, we used the mouse to create a simple interactive test for controlling the position of Kunpeng. And we connected the real-time image output of Kunpeng to ComfyUI.

For the choice of visual changes, we chose the dynamics and blending of particles. Because this is similar to the feedback loop in a topological network. In topology, a continuous feedback loop can be regarded as a mapping that continuously pulls back the system state and promotes its evolution to a new state. Similarly, our visual system intuitively presents the iterative process of the algorithm by rendering the dynamic changes of particles in real time. Each gathering and dispersing change of particles is not only an instantaneous manifestation of the local state but also an externalized manifestation of the feedback mechanism of the entire system.

Just as emphasized in our project concept: the continuous transformation and mutual integration between all things.

### Touchdesigner gesture interaction construction
We later added a webcam and made the interaction method into two-handed control and conducted tests.

The two hands each undertake different control tasks, just like the dual identities of Kun and Peng in ancient mythology. The right hand triggers the collapse and aggregation of the particle system, presenting a local minimum state in chaos (that is, the form of "Kun"), while the left hand guides the particles to expand and rise in a higher dimension, symbolizing the transformation from chaos to an orderly and grand "Peng". This division of labor makes the interactive experience more layered and reflects the dynamic balance and mutual transformation between the two states.

## Design Justification 
- Interaction design improvement:
  
Issue: The two-handed interaction method is not intuitive and has a high learning cost.

Intuitive feedback: Design clear visual feedback for the user's gesture operations, such as displaying the current transformation status in real time on the screen (such as using a progress bar, color gradient, or icon prompts), so that users can clearly see the correspondence between gestures and effects at a glance.

- Internationalization reconstruction:
  
Issue: The mythical image of Kunpeng lacks a cognitive basis for non-East Asian audiences.

Solution: Kun → Quantum marine organism, with a flowing form composed of fluorescent jellyfish particle swarms. The surface texture simulates the mineral deposition of deep-sea hydrothermal vents. The movement trajectory presents the universal mathematical beauty of the Fibonacci spiral. Peng → Cosmic energy body, taking supernova remnants as the styling prototype. The wings adopt a dynamic material of polarized light interference fringes.

(ps. But of course, I think this may not be a perfect solution either. After all, cultural foundation is the basis for resonating with works. Modifying it into Western visual language is difficult to express the thought of Zhuangzi's Kunpeng. Perhaps in the future we will have a better integration method? The essence of Zhuangzi's philosophy lies in the dynamic process of "materialization" rather than a specific image. Directly replacing Kunpeng with Western symbols is essentially replacing process philosophy with static counterparts, resulting in the preservation of form but the loss of spirit.)
