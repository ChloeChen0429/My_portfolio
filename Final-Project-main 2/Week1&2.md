At the initial stage of the project, I mainly focused on thinking about the final creative direction. I have always been interested in the relationship between emotion and technology, and in previous works I have experimented with connecting sound, visuals, and emotional signals. During this early conceptual phase, a core idea gradually emerged: I wanted to build an emotion-driven system where emotion becomes the real-time input for performance.
At the same time, my interest in techno music also influenced the direction of the project. After watching many DJ/VJ performances, I realized that although music and visuals always appear together, the two systems are often separated and operated by different people, with very limited real-time interaction between them. I hoped to break this division and create a more direct link between music, visuals, and the human performer, allowing emotion to actively participate in the generative process.
The main goal of this stage was to define the concept, narrow down the research direction, and clarify two key questions: why emotion, and why techno.
Below is my research proposal:
