During Weeks 17 and 18, I shifted my focus from music to the visual component of the project. Before this stage, my attempts to generate visuals in ComfyUI had already shown major performance limitations—the system could not support real-time generation or even rapid preview, making it unsuitable for a live performance workflow. With this constraint in mind, I redirected my approach toward creating pre-rendered visual assets that could later be controlled and manipulated in real time.

I began by designing the core visual identity of the system. Inspired by Anyma’s cyber-organic stage aesthetics, I decided to centre the visual narrative around a female robot capable of sensing, receiving, and expressing human emotions. This character became the symbolic counterpart to the performer: an entity born from emotional signals, reflecting the themes of transformation and co-creation.

To establish a consistent visual base, I used Runway to generate keyframe images for each of the seven emotion categories. After refining the concept, I expanded each emotion into a short narrative “micro-scene”, capturing how the robot behaves under different affective states—for example, anger becoming forceful or breaking through the screen, while neutral remains calm and steady. Based on these narrative cues, I generated seven foundational video clips, each one corresponding to a single emotion class. These videos later served as the primary material for the interactive visual system in TouchDesigner.
